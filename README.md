# DataStorm - A Distributed Data Exchange Framework

DataStorm is a distributed data exchange framework enabling applications to
share data and associated updates in a fully distributed manner with no single
point of failure. It is composed of a library that provides APIs used by
programs to get in touch to exchange data. It can be viewed as a data bus where
different programs publish or subscribe to updates for a set of data elements.

You can download DataStorm releases from [ZeroC's website](https://zeroc.com/downloads/datastorm).
